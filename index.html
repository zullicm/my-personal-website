        <p>Brief history about me<span id="firstDots">...</span><span id="firstMore">I have always been interested in technology, I was 
          introduced to them at a young age by my father. He works in I.T. so I have always had some sort of computer in the house. So 
          when I got the opportunity to learn more about them in High School I always chose to, and I took all of the computer classes I 
          saw available and even went to vocational school for computer service and repair. Oddly enough though I found out it really isnt 
          what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. At the time this was upsetting and frustrating for me, and as I went into college 
          the following year I found the wind knocked out of my sails and unsure as to what my path would be if it wasn't some form of I.T. 
          or networking. So I decided to take a break, and see what possibilities the work force had for me. I had started out just being 
          a landscapper for a private company. I eventually moved on to working part-time for a nearby town in the public works, where I 
          worked on the back of a garbage truck. Whether there was a hurricane rolling in, a winter storm blasting through, or it was a 
          sweltering summer day. I found myself on the back of a garbage truck, and I know it sounds bad, and it was, but I knew there 
          was a light at the end of the tunnel. When working for townships part time employees are typically picked up to be full-time 
          employees. And I knew that ny hard work would eventually be noticed, AND IT WAS. I got accepted to be fulltime in the town I 
          live in as an equipment operator for their public works! A great job, great healthcare and benafits, and the pay wasn't bad 
          either...</span> <button onclick="firstMore()" id="firstBtn">Read more</button> </p>

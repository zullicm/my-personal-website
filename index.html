        <p id="first"><span id="firstDots">A Brief History About Me...</span><span id="firstMore">I have always been interested in technology, I was 
          introduced to them at a young age by my father. He works in I.T. so I have always had some sort of computer in the house. So 
          when I got the opportunity to learn more about them in High School I always chose to, and I took all of the computer classes I 
          saw available and even went to vocational school for computer service and repair. Oddly enough though I found out it really isnt 
          what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. At the time this was upsetting and frustrating for me, and as I went into college 
          the following year I found the wind knocked out of my sails and unsure as to what my path would be if it wasn't some form of I.T. 
          or networking. So I decided to take a break, and see what possibilities the work force had for me. I had started out just being 
          a landscapper for a private company. I eventually moved on to working part-time for a nearby town in the public works, where I 
          worked on the back of a garbage truck. Whether there was a hurricane rolling in, a winter storm blasting through, or it was a 
          sweltering summer day. I found myself on the back of a garbage truck, and I know it sounds bad, and it was, but I knew there 
          was a light at the end of the tunnel. When working for townships part time employees are typically picked up to be full-time 
          employees. And I knew that ny hard work would eventually be noticed, AND IT WAS. I got accepted to be fulltime in the town I 
          live in as an equipment operator for their public works! A great job, great healthcare and benafits, and the pay wasn't bad 
          either...

          <p id="second"><span id="secondDots">What I plan do to now...</span><span id="secondMore">...but it just wasn't it. 
            I had put four long grueling years in working hard landscapping and garbage throwing. Reaching a goal I had aspired 
            for and at a young age as well. Most people weren't yet in my position until they're in their 30, and at the time I 
            had just turned 21 after two months in the job. But I didnt find the happiness I was looking for. It wasn't immediate, 
            it took time for me to come to this conclusion, but eventually I realized that I had to change my path once more. I was 
            lucky as well, my cousin, he went through what he called a programming boot camp, he said the school was Flatiron..? 
            Knowing my feelings and love for technology I decided to look into it and I couldn't believe I hadn't thought of it earlier. 
            Programming! It was the perfect match, I did a small amount in high school and really enjoyed those parts unlike the 
            networking that I found rather dull. This was different. I got to create and probem solve, really use my brain on projects 
            and figure out how all these cool websites that I loved visiting worked. So I saved, I saved for months, so that i could 
            quit my dayjob and sustain myself and bills while I go to school and pursue something I actually enjoyed!

              truly want to learn to code with the best of them. I aspire for great things and to not be stagnent. I don't ever
               want to stop learning, and I want to accomplish great many things! After talking to and looking into other schools
               flatiron seems to be the right fit for me to get there! I am anxious, but I am signifigantly more excited for what 
               the future holds for me during my time here at Flatiron and beyond.
